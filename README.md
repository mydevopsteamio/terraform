Naming Conventions
===================

- In [mydevopsteam.io](https://mydevopsteam.io). We are basically using the standard naming conventions from this source: [https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/naming](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/naming)

- Never repeat resource type names like this `resource "aws_instance" "aws_ec2_instance" {` which makes our code ugly and confusing.
